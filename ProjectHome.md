In the military annually we must create bullets to be places into annual performance appraisals as well as throughout the year with quarterly and annual awards.  This tool is to address the issue of most people's "I love me" file being inadequate.  This will allow people to store information, work on bullets, and generate reports based on certain criteria to more easily facilitate the bullet writing process.

**Help**

If you would like to help let me know.  I'm a very amateurish coder but hope to at least get this up to version 1.

If you have suggestions or additional requirements, we can always add those to the list for future versions of the program.

**Version 1 Requirements:  (still subject to minor change)**

1. Store data -- year, quarter, background information, draft bullet, bullet version, type of bullet (volunteer, self-improvement, main job), whether the bullet has been used in any document (award/appraisal), and who did the work (for supervisors)

2.  Track bullet versions -- as draft bullet gets updated per entry, track the previous bullets

3.  Ability to edit bullets and work on bullets from within the program itself

4.  Generate reports based on year, quarter(s), worker, and type of bullet.
